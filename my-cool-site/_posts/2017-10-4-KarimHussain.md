# Career Goals

Howdy! My name is Karim Hussain.

As a technology management major, my area of knowledge involves unix systems administration, end user support, cybersecurity,
and DevOps. Furthermore, I have taken a variety of business and human resources courses, such as marketing, finance, HR
analytics, applied learning principles, and business law.

For a career, I hope to go into Human Resources Management, with an emphasis in information systems and organizational
development. After graduating from Texas A&M in May 2018, I will enter the human resources field, and then return for my
masters degree in HR Management through Mays Business School. 

I am thankful for the technology management program for equipping me with necessary and sought-after technical skills that 
will assist me in the workforce.
