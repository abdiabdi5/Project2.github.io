# Zach Gutierrez

# Career Goals & a little bit about myself

Howdy! My name is Zach Gutierrez

As a Technology management Major, my area of knowledge involves Unix Systems Administration, End User Support, and CyberSecurity.

Some of my hobbies include working out and playing sports. I played football and baseball in highschool. I played linebacker in football
and I pitched in baseball. I hope to someday get a career in IT.
