# Career Goals 

Howdy! My name is Avnett Singh 

Being in a technology management management it has been a really challenging thing for me. The good thing is, I am learning a lot about the technology world that surprises me everyday. I am excited for what the future holds for me. I am graduating in August 2018, and I am in my senior year at Texas A&M. My short-term goal is to work for a company for about four to five years, before pursuing for my masters. That way I will be able to figure what exactly I want to continue my masters in. I hope whatever I am learning now at Texas A&M I will be able to put it into practice, once I graduate. 

I enjoy being in technology management, because it gives me the perspective of the technological world, as well as the management perspective. I have been really found of management, since I was young. Some day, I hope I will be able to run an organization or a company.
