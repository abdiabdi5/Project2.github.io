# Juan Segura 

# Career Goals

Howdy! My name is Juan Segura.

As a technology management major, my area of knowledge involves unix systems administration, end user support, and cybersecurity.

For a career, I hope to throw everything I have learned out the window and simply becoming a professional soccer player. I will have to
work very hard to get in shape but it will be a dream come true. I love working in tech but I am simply to young to work in corporate America.
